## Min review of the book
The book has good examples for the design patterns, all based around food. It does however lack some key information such as what you need to import and how to structure the project. There is also a fair bit of inconsistency in the naming and the programming style changes as the book continues. But overall, if you want a refresher or to learn more design patterns, then the 22 day format of the book is easily achievable and I would recommend it.

If you include the following in each file, you should be set.
```
using System; // Console.WriteLine
using System.Linq; // Where method
using System.Collections.Generic; // List
```

Files should be structured so that you have the main Program.cs and a design pattern specific cs for the pattern itself to go in. Take a look at the examples for a more clear idea.
